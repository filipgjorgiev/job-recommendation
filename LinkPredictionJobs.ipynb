The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\n\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\\\\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\\\\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\\\\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\\\n\\\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\\\\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\\\\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\\\\\\\\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\\\\\\\\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\\\\\\\\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\\\\\\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\\\\\\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\\\\\\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\\\\\\\\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\\\\\\\\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan\\\\\\\\napproach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\nRoles and Responsibilities: Development, Testing and support.\\\\\\\\nSoftware Used: Oracle 9i\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOTHER PROJECTS AND REAL TIME TRAINING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRTRM(Railway Ticketing System Through Mobile)\\\\\\\\nA mobile based real time application with many exciting features like checking pnr status, train\\\\\\\\navailability, trains between stations etc. This application was done in j2me and it uses weblogic\\\\\\\\nas server and MSSQL as the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUndergone a mandatory Training on Finance By Oracle Corporation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEDUCATION\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBirla Institute Of Technology -

YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re energized by getting product in front of customers, and prefer an iterative approach with regular deliveries to your stakeholders versus all-at-once major releases. You see QA as a valuable stakeholder in enabling development teams, rather than an auditor simply finding bugs. You hold yourself accountable for shipping regularly.

Bias for action: You are independent and self-driven, with a high degree of ownership over problems. You err on the side of taking action when needed, and know how to balance this with the need to research and understand problems. Kindness and respect: You strive to be a positive influence on the team. You have respect for yourself, your teammates, your leaders, and your stakeholders, and you expect that others have that same respect for you.

Recharge is recognized on the Technology Fast 500, awarded by Deloitte, (3rd consecutive year) and is Great Place to Work Certified. Overview The QA group at Recharge is responsible for maintaining high quality software products through automated testing pipelines, manual feature testing, and product reliability monitoring. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be joining a product engineering team working on a mix of greenfield features and enhancing existing product lines. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be working on automation testing, collaborating with engineers in developing test plans for feature developmentÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  and improving tooling. As a senior SDET, your work will have a meaningful impact on our business as we grow. As a senior engineer in test you will: Work collaboratively with your fellow engineers and product counterparts to pragmatically develop products Develop automation tests to monitor and maintain health of Recharge product features as our codebase changes over time Review merge requests and pair with engineers to understand and review code as shipped Apply your own knowledge and experience to work through engineering challenges Our Tech Stack: Python, Flask, GCP, Elasticsearch, Redis, SaaS, CloudSQL/MySQL, Terraform, OpenTelemetry, Docker, Kubernetes, Splunk, SignalFx, Sentry About you: Execution: You want to get things done. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re energized by getting product in front of customers, and prefer an iterative approach with regular deliveries to your stakeholders versus all-at-once major releases. You see QA as a valuable stakeholder in enabling development teams, rather than an auditor simply finding bugs. You hold yourself accountable for shipping regularly. You understand merchant feedback is key in building the right thing and are flexible to handle changes in direction. Engineering excellence: You have strong experience in building complex systems, both in zero-to-one contexts and incremental changes to existing systems. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re confident in contributing to both paradigms. You think about quality, reliability, and observability, and know how to take a risk-based approach in balancing these concerns with speed of delivery. (And, also, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re pretty familiar with Python. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to use it a lot here.) Communication: You are a sound communicator across multiple mediums, including in-person, video, chat, and written documentation. You enjoy regular collaboration with others and believe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s important to ship out high quality work. While you understand the value of focused work, you believe that feedback from your peers and brainstorming on architecture is important to producing something great. Pragmatic: You productively work with your leadership, your product counterparts, and your team to deal with the realities on the ground on a day-to-day basis. You know plans change as we learn, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re flexible to deal with those changes as they come. Fuzzy requirements are far more common than clearly defined customer expectations, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re able to help work through the ambiguity with your teammates. Bias for action: You are independent and self-driven, with a high degree of ownership over problems. You err on the side of taking action when needed, and know how to balance this with the need to research and understand problems. Kindness and respect: You strive to be a positive influence on the team. You have respect for yourself, your teammates, your leaders, and your stakeholders, and you expect that others have that same respect for you. You want this role to be a place where your contributions are understood and valued, and you want to work with others to make sure that happens. Ambitious: YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re looking to grow. Whether that means a staff engineer role one day or a management role, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re looking to push yourself and raise the bar for your teammates. You want to succeed, and you want to do the right things to succeed with us. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re looking for a role where you can make a meaningful impact, because you know thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the ticket upward.

Today, Recharge powers more than 20,000 merchants serving 100 million subscribers, including brands such as Blueland, Hello Bello, LOLA, Chamberlain Coffee, and BobbieÃ¢â‚¬â€�Recharge doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just help you sell products, we help build buyer routines that last. Recharge is recognized on the Technology Fast 500, awarded by Deloitte, (3rd consecutive year) and is Great Place to Work Certified. Overview The QA group at Recharge is responsible for maintaining high quality software products through automated testing pipelines, manual feature testing, and product reliability monitoring. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be joining a product engineering team working on a mix of greenfield features and enhancing existing product lines. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be working on automation testing, collaborating with engineers in developing test plans for feature developmentÃ‚Â  and improving tooling. As a senior SDET, your work will have a meaningful impact on our business as we grow. As a senior engineer in test you will: Work collaboratively with your fellow engineers and product counterparts to pragmatically develop products Develop automation tests to monitor and maintain health of Recharge product features as our codebase changes over time Review merge requests and pair with engineers to understand and review code as shipped Apply your own knowledge and experience to work through engineering challenges Our Tech Stack: Python, Flask, GCP, Elasticsearch, Redis, SaaS, CloudSQL/MySQL, Terraform, OpenTelemetry, Docker, Kubernetes, Splunk, SignalFx, Sentry About you: Execution: You want to get things done. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re energized by getting product in front of customers, and prefer an iterative approach with regular deliveries to your stakeholders versus all-at-once major releases. You see QA as a valuable stakeholder in enabling development teams, rather than an auditor simply finding bugs. You hold yourself accountable for shipping regularly. You understand merchant feedback is key in building the right thing and are flexible to handle changes in direction. Engineering excellence: You have strong experience in building complex systems, both in zero-to-one contexts and incremental changes to existing systems. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re confident in contributing to both paradigms. You think about quality, reliability, and observability, and know how to take a risk-based approach in balancing these concerns with speed of delivery. (And, also, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pretty familiar with Python. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to use it a lot here.) Communication: You are a sound communicator across multiple mediums, including in-person, video, chat, and written documentation. You enjoy regular collaboration with others and believe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to ship out high quality work. While you understand the value of focused work, you believe that feedback from your peers and brainstorming on architecture is important to producing something great. Pragmatic: You productively work with your leadership, your product counterparts, and your team to deal with the realities on the ground on a day-to-day basis. You know plans change as we learn, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re flexible to deal with those changes as they come. Fuzzy requirements are far more common than clearly defined customer expectations, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re able to help work through the ambiguity with your teammates. Bias for action: You are independent and self-driven, with a high degree of ownership over problems. You err on the side of taking action when needed, and know how to balance this with the need to research and understand problems. Kindness and respect: You strive to be a positive influence on the team. You have respect for yourself, your teammates, your leaders, and your stakeholders, and you expect that others have that same respect for you. You want this role to be a place where your contributions are understood and valued, and you want to work with others to make sure that happens. Ambitious: YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to grow. Whether that means a staff engineer role one day or a management role, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to push yourself and raise the bar for your teammates. You want to succeed, and you want to do the right things to succeed with us. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for a role where you can make a meaningful impact, because you know thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the ticket upward.

Recharge is recognized on the Technology Fast 500, awarded by Deloitte, (3rd consecutive year) and is Great Place to Work Certified. Overview The QA group at Recharge is responsible for maintaining high quality software products through automated testing pipelines, manual feature testing, and product reliability monitoring. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be joining a product engineering team working on a mix of greenfield features and enhancing existing product lines. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be working on automation testing, collaborating with engineers in developing test plans for feature developmentÃ‚Â  and improving tooling. As a senior SDET, your work will have a meaningful impact on our business as we grow. As a senior engineer in test you will: Work collaboratively with your fellow engineers and product counterparts to pragmatically develop products Develop automation tests to monitor and maintain health of Recharge product features as our codebase changes over time Review merge requests and pair with engineers to understand and review code as shipped Apply your own knowledge and experience to work through engineering challenges Our Tech Stack: Python, Flask, GCP, Elasticsearch, Redis, SaaS, CloudSQL/MySQL, Terraform, OpenTelemetry, Docker, Kubernetes, Splunk, SignalFx, Sentry About you: Execution: You want to get things done. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re energized by getting product in front of customers, and prefer an iterative approach with regular deliveries to your stakeholders versus all-at-once major releases. You see QA as a valuable stakeholder in enabling development teams, rather than an auditor simply finding bugs. You hold yourself accountable for shipping regularly. You understand merchant feedback is key in building the right thing and are flexible to handle changes in direction. Engineering excellence: You have strong experience in building complex systems, both in zero-to-one contexts and incremental changes to existing systems. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re confident in contributing to both paradigms. You think about quality, reliability, and observability, and know how to take a risk-based approach in balancing these concerns with speed of delivery. (And, also, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pretty familiar with Python. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to use it a lot here.) Communication: You are a sound communicator across multiple mediums, including in-person, video, chat, and written documentation. You enjoy regular collaboration with others and believe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to ship out high quality work. While you understand the value of focused work, you believe that feedback from your peers and brainstorming on architecture is important to producing something great. Pragmatic: You productively work with your leadership, your product counterparts, and your team to deal with the realities on the ground on a day-to-day basis. You know plans change as we learn, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re flexible to deal with those changes as they come. Fuzzy requirements are far more common than clearly defined customer expectations, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re able to help work through the ambiguity with your teammates. Bias for action: You are independent and self-driven, with a high degree of ownership over problems. You err on the side of taking action when needed, and know how to balance this with the need to research and understand problems. Kindness and respect: You strive to be a positive influence on the team. You have respect for yourself, your teammates, your leaders, and your stakeholders, and you expect that others have that same respect for you. You want this role to be a place where your contributions are understood and valued, and you want to work with others to make sure that happens. Ambitious: YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to grow. Whether that means a staff engineer role one day or a management role, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to push yourself and raise the bar for your teammates. You want to succeed, and you want to do the right things to succeed with us. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for a role where you can make a meaningful impact, because you know thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the ticket upward.

You think about quality, reliability, and observability, and know how to take a risk-based approach in balancing these concerns with speed of delivery. (And, also, youâ€™re pretty familiar with Python. Youâ€™re going to use it a lot here.) Communication: You are a sound communicator across multiple mediums, including in-person, video, chat, and written documentation. You enjoy regular collaboration with others and believe itâ€™s important to ship out high quality work. While you understand the value of focused work, you believe that feedback from your peers and brainstorming on architecture is important to producing something great. Pragmatic: You productively work with your leadership, your product counterparts, and your team to deal with the realities on the ground on a day-to-day basis. You know plans change as we learn, and youâ€™re flexible to deal with those changes as they come. Fuzzy requirements are far more common than clearly defined customer expectations, and youâ€™re able to help work through the ambiguity with your teammates. Bias for action: You are independent and self-driven, with a high degree of ownership over problems. You err on the side of taking action when needed, and know how to balance this with the need to research and understand problems. Kindness and respect: You strive to be a positive influence on the team. You have respect for yourself, your teammates, your leaders, and your stakeholders, and you expect that others have that same respect for you. You want this role to be a place where your contributions are understood and valued, and you want to work with others to make sure that happens. Ambitious: Youâ€™re looking to grow. Whether that means a staff engineer role one day or a management role, youâ€™re looking to push yourself and raise the bar for your teammates. You want to succeed, and you want to do the right things to succeed with us. Youâ€™re looking for a role where you can make a meaningful impact, because you know thatâ€™s the ticket upward.

Youâ€™re energized by getting product in front of customers, and prefer an iterative approach with regular deliveries to your stakeholders versus all-at-once major releases. You see QA as a valuable stakeholder in enabling development teams, rather than an auditor simply finding bugs. You hold yourself accountable for shipping regularly. You understand merchant feedback is key in building the right thing and are flexible to handle changes in direction. Engineering excellence: You have strong experience in building complex systems, both in zero-to-one contexts and incremental changes to existing systems. Youâ€™re confident in contributing to both paradigms.

You err on the side of taking action when needed, and know how to balance this with the need to research and understand problems. Kindness and respect: You strive to be a positive influence on the team. You have respect for yourself, your teammates, your leaders, and your stakeholders, and you expect that others have that same respect for you. You want this role to be a place where your contributions are understood and valued, and you want to work with others to make sure that happens. Ambitious: Youâ€™re looking to grow. Whether that means a staff engineer role one day or a management role, youâ€™re looking to push yourself and raise the bar for your teammates. You want to succeed, and you want to do the right things to succeed with us. Youâ€™re looking for a role where you can make a meaningful impact, because you know thatâ€™s the ticket upward.
